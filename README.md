# PasswordGenerator
The purpose of this project is to create a password generator using random numbers as well as for and while loops.

We are supposed to if statements, for and while loops to determine the information. 

This project allows for random passcodes to be developed based on the user's options/selections.

<+s>: This program helped me utilize the knowledge I gained from 4.03 and 4.06 to actual create a project that solves a problem. 

<-s>: Again, I did run into some issues here and there. however, I was able to overcome the challenges. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding how to do this will help me in the future.
 

I understood how to read and write a file using PrintWriter and inFile.next. 
In addition, I used if statements and while loops to successful generate random numbers, letters, and characters for the program.
